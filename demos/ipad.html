		Demo 3: Apple.com's iPad Hero
	</h2>

	<p>
		This demo shows the image which Apple.com used for its iPad hero when the 3rd gen iPad launched.
		Its standard pixel size is 1454x605 (110KB filesize), whereas the high-resolution pixel size is 2908x1210 (352KB filesize).
		Its a huge friggin' picture, and you wouldn't want to download both of these when you'll only be viewing one of them.
	</p>

	<p>
		If there is a red border on the top and bottom of the image then it is being viewed in standard-resolution. If the image
		has a green border on the top and bottom then it is being viewed in high-resolution.
	</p>

	<p>
		This example does not do any server image resizing, but instead uses the data-src-high-resolution attribute to
		state which image src to use when this page is high-resolution enabled.
	</p>
