	<p>
		Its best to view the demos using a high resolution display because currently most 
		desktop and laptop displays do not have a device pixel ratio greater than one. Additionally,
		each demo has full debugging information included so you can see how the images have adjusted
		for each device.

	<p>
		This example displays images which have a browser width set at 320 pixels, but the image's the requested
		width adjusts according to the device pixel ratio. Compare the high-resolution images to the standard-resolution 
		(you can only see the difference on a hi-res display).
