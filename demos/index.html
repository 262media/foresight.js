	<h1>Foresight.js Demos</h1>

	<p>
		Its best to view the demos using a high resolution display because currently most 
		desktop and laptop displays do not have a device pixel ratio greater than one. Additionally,
		each demo has full debugging information included so you can see how the images have adjusted
		for each device.

	<h3>
		<a href="basic-resizing.html">Demo 1: Basic Resizing</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This demo displays images which have a browser width set at 320 pixels, but the image's requested
		width adjusts according to the device pixel ratio. Compare the high-resolution images to the standard-resolution 
		(you can only see the difference on a hi-res display).

	<h3>
		<a href="parent-element-percentage.html">Demo 2: Parent Element Percentage</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This demo expands the image browser pixels to 100% of its parent element's width, and requests an image 
		width adjusted to the device pixel ratio.

		<a href="ipad.html">Demo 3: Apple.com's iPad Hero</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This example does not do any server image resizing, but instead uses the data-src-high-resolution attribute to
		state which image src to use when this page is high-resolution enabled.

	<h3>
		<a href="jquery-mobile-page-1.html">Demo 4: jQuery Mobile Pages</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This demo shows how foresight.js can be integrated with jQuery mobile. You can use existing jQuery Mobile
		functionality to help adjust images when a device is rotated. Additionally, jQuery Mobile pages can use
		ajax calls to retrieve the next page which updates the DOM, not refresh the entire page. This demo shows
		how foresight is updated after page transitions.
