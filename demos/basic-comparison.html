	<h2>
		Demo 1: Basic Image Comparison
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Below are some examples of high-resolution and standard-resolution images so you can compare their quality 
		side-by-side. Images with a green border are the high-resolution, and images with the red border are the 
		standard-resolution. The image browser widths are set at 320 pixels. If both images have a red border 
		then you're not viewing them on a hi-res display (or your network connection is slow).
	</p>
	<p>
		The high-resolution image widths will be 320 pixels multiplied by the scale factor, so a device with a
		pixel resolution of 2 would request an image width of 640 pixels. However, a standard monitor with a 
		pixel ratio of 1 or a device with a slow connection would still only request an image that's 320 pixels wide.
	</p>
